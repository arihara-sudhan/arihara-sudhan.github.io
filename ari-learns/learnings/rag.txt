1. RAG - Introduced by Dr.Patrick Lewis
2. LLM Limitation
	- Knowledge Cut-Off
	- Bound to Public Information
	- Hallucination: Lying with Confidence
	- Context Problems
		CONTEXT WINDOW = 5 TOKENS
		MY DOG IS SASI
		MY ~DOG IS?~
		Where, the model forgets ~TOKENS~
3. Parametric Memory
	- The knowledge is stored within a Model's Parameters
	- Recall and generate information without accessing external storage
4. Non-Parametric Memory
	- RAG System generate information, accessing external storage (DB)
	- Knowledge Base of RAG
5. Basic Components/Actions in RAG
   Query - User Queries something
   Retrieval - Fetched from Database based on Query
   Augmentation - Query + Retrieved Information + Prompt*
   Generation - LLM responds based on prompt/query
6. Source Citation
	- Ability of RAG System to point out to the information from KB
7. Unlimited Memory
	- Any number of documents can be added
8. Indexing Pipeline
	- Set of Processes employed to create the KB
	- Non Real Time, Periodic
9. Metadata: Data about Data
	- Timestamp, Author, Topic, Summarization
	- Enhances Search Ability
	- Child to Parent Indexing where Children have specific detail (Metadata) and Parents have Actual Data
10. Data Masking
	- Obfuscation of Sensitive Information (Such as PII)
11. Chunking: Splitting the corpus into meaningful pieces of information for effective search and overcoming context window problems
	- Decontextualization: Separating pieces out of surroundings (corpus)
12. Lost in The Middle
	- The Tendency of LLMs to overlook or forget information placed in the middle of long context inputs, focusing more on the beginning and end
13. Chunking Types
	- Fixed Chunking (Fixed Size with Overlaps)
	- Structured Chunking (JSON/XML/HTML)
	- Agentic Chunking (Applying Neural Networks)
	- Small to Big Chunking (Compact Small Units Merged)
	- Context Enriched Chunking: Make each chunk self-contained (Semantic Meaning): Hero/Subject instead of pronouns such as It,He,She and so on
	- Semantic Chunking
14. Chunk Size: Number of Tokens to be in a Chunk
15. Embeddings: Meaningful Numerical Representation of Data
	Examples: Word2Vec, FastText, Glove, BERT, ElMO
16. Cosine Similarity= A⋅B / ∣∣A∣∣⋅∣∣B∣∣
17. Vector Databases
	- To handle HIGH Dimensional Vectors
	- Stores & Indexes'em Efficiently
	- Examples: FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone
