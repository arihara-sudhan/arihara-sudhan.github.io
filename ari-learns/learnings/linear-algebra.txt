1. Vector: Collection of Numbers with Direction
"A vector is basically something that has both a magnitude (size) and a direction"

2. Matrix: If the vectors are v = (1,2,3) and w = (1,3,4), put them into the columns of a matrix:
	1 1
	2 3
	3 4
3. Linear Combination:
	A linear combination of vectors v1, v2, …, vk is any vector that can be written as:
		c1 * v1 + c2 * v2 + … + ck * vk
	where c1, c2, …, ck are scalars (numbers).
	This means you take each vector, multiply it by a number, and then add them up. The result is called a linear combination.
4. Scalar Multiplication on A Vector
⭐ Positive scalar (like 2, 3, 0.5)
	The direction stays the same.
	The length (magnitude) changes.
	Example: If v = [2,1] and you multiply by 2 → [4,2].
	The arrow points the same way but is twice as long.
⭐ Negative scalar (like –1, –2)
	The length still changes, but…
	The direction flips (points in the exact opposite direction).
⭐ Zero scalar
	The vector becomes [0,0,...,0].
	It has no length, no direction (just disappears into a point).
5. Column Space
v1 = [1 2 3]
v2 = [4 5 6]
	c * v1 + d * v2
		= c * [1, 2, 3] + d * [4, 5, 6]
		= [c, 2c, 3c] + [4d, 5d, 6d]
		= [c + 4d, 2c + 5d, 3c + 6d]
		Where c and d ⋹ (… –2, –1.5, 0, 1, 2, 100, etc.)
The column space of a matrix A is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of A.
If A = [v1 v2 … vk]
(where v1, v2, …, vk are the column vectors of A), then
Col(A) = { c1*v1 + c2*v2 + … + ck*vk  |  c1, c2, …, ck are real numbers }
In other words, Col(A) = span{v1, v2, …, vk}.
6. Column Span and Row Span
Column span = all vectors you can make by mixing the columns
Row span = all vectors you can make by mixing the rows.
7. Vector Space: A vector space is a collection of vectors that you can: Add together Multiply by numbers (scalars) …and still stay inside that collection.
“Vectors” can be anything: arrows, lists of numbers, functions, etc.
“Scalars” are just numbers (real numbers, usually).
Rules a Vector Space Must Follow
	For a set of vectors to be a vector space, it must satisfy 8 rules (called axioms):
	1. Addition is closed:
	If u and v are in the space, u + v is also in the space.
	2. Additive identity exists:
	There is a zero vector 0 such that v + 0 = v for all v.
	3. Additive inverse exists:
	For every v, there is –v such that v + (–v) = 0.
	4. Addition is commutative:
	u + v = v + u
	5. Addition is associative:
	(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)
	6. Scalar multiplication is closed:
	For any number c and vector v, c * v is in the space.
	7. Multiplying by 1 works:
	1 * v = v
	8. Distributive properties hold:
	c*(u + v) = cu + cv
	(c + d)v = cv + d*v

8. Rank: Take all columns: v1, v2, ..., vn.
Find the largest set of vectors where none can be written as a combination of the others. The number of vectors in that set = rank.
	v1  v2  v3
	1	2	0
	2	4	1
	3	6  -1
		v2 = 2v1
		ρ = 2
Example:
	A = [ 1  2  3 ]
	    [ 4  5  6 ]
	    [ 7  8  9 ]
	PIVOT = A[0][0]
	row2 = row2 - 4*row1
		 = [ 4  5  6 ] - [ 4  8  12 ]
		 = [0 -3 -6]

	row3 = row3 - 7*row1
		 = [ 7  8  9 ] - [7  14  21]
		 = [0  -6  -12]

	RESULT-1
		[ 1  2  3 ]
		[ 0 -3 -6 ]
		[ 0 -6 -12 ]

	PIVOT = A[1][1]
	row3 = row3 - 2*row2
	RESULT-2
		[ 1  2  3 ]
		[ 0 -3 -6 ]
		[ 0  0  0 ]
	STOP AS
	We are doing row-reduction / elimination to find row-echelon form. You stop when: All rows below the pivots are zero or can’t be reduced further. You’ve gone through all columns or all rows.
	Rank, ρ = Number of Non-Zero Rows = 2
