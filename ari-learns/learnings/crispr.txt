1. Zinc Finger Protein: Recognizer of DNA Bases: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine
2. Nuclease: Cutting Protein
3. ZFNs: Zinc Finger Protein + Nuclease: Kandupidi + Cut Pannu
4. If a sequence is common say, ACG, cutting them all will lead to Cell Death, Cancer
 - Zing Finger can bind only with a nucleotide of 3 bases
 - CRISPR turn offs Genes which let us know to what property that particular Gene Combination contribute to
 - We need to do Gene-Knockout using Technologies like CRISPR
5. If a sequence is uncommon  say, ACGTTGCAACTGGTCTA, cutting this unique sequence is precise
 - We target only the disease-causing gene
 - Leave the rest of the genome untouched
6. CRISPR: Pattern found in Bacterial DNA
  Pattern: REPEAT-UNIQUE-REPEAT-UNIQUE-REPEAT
  REPEAT: Short and Similar
  UNIQUE: Comes from Viral Attack to Bacteria
7. Bacteria recorded memories of past viral infections in its DNA using CRISPR. Like a ‚Äúwanted‚Äù list for viruses
8. Cas Protein: Cas proteins can cut DNA at very specific spots
Cas9	Cuts double-stranded DNA: Gene editing (most common)
Cas12	Also cuts DNA, but can do more types of cuts: Advanced editing
Cas13	Cuts RNA instead of DNA	RNA editing and diagnostics
9. PAM: PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) is a short DNA sequence that is essential for CRISPR-Cas9 to recognize and cut a specific target in the genome. Cas9 doesn't search directly for the target sequence; instead, it scans the DNA for the PAM sequence (commonly "NGG"), and only when it finds PAM does it check the 20 bases just before it to see if they match the guide RNA. Without PAM, Cas9 won‚Äôt even stop to check the DNA ‚Äî meaning no recognition, no binding, and no cutting. So, PAM acts like a ‚Äúlicense‚Äù or ‚Äútrigger‚Äù that tells Cas9 where it's allowed to cut.
10. Double-Stranded Break: When Cas9 cuts the DNA, it breaks both strands of the DNA double helix at the target spot
11. Cut will be HEALED: REPAIRED AUTOMATICALLY
	NHEJ (Non-Homologous End Joining) is the cell‚Äôs quick and easy way of fixing broken DNA. When CRISPR cuts the DNA, the cell rushes to glue the ends back together. This method is fast and happens in most cells, but it‚Äôs not very careful ‚Äî it often makes small mistakes by adding or removing a few letters (called insertions or deletions). These little errors can break the gene so it no longer works. That‚Äôs why NHEJ is useful when we want to turn off or knock out a gene.
	HDR (Homology Directed Repair) is a slower but smarter way the cell can fix DNA. Instead of just gluing the ends, it uses a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù ‚Äî like a copy or instruction manual ‚Äî to fix or replace the damaged part. This method is very accurate and allows scientists to correct gene mutations or even insert new genes. However, HDR only works well under certain conditions, usually when the cell is dividing. Because of this, HDR is harder to use, but it‚Äôs great for precise gene editing.
12. The gRNA (guide RNA) acts like a GPS, directing the Cas9 protein to the specific DNA sequence that needs to be cut. However, Cas9 can‚Äôt cut just anywhere‚Äîit needs to see a small tag next to the target site called the PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif). PAM isn‚Äôt part of the guidance system but acts like a "cut here" signal or a permission slip; without it, Cas9 won‚Äôt make the cut, even if the gRNA is correct. So, the gRNA shows where to go, and the PAM confirms whether it‚Äôs allowed to cut there.
13. Vectors: To get Cas9 and gRNA into the cell, we need a carrier (like a box) to deliver them. These carriers are called vectors
14. OFFTARGETS: Off-targets are accidental edits in the wrong place

15. WHIM Syndrome: Affecting just a few dozen people worldwide, WHIM is a painful, potentially deadly immunodeficiency disease that makes life difficult for those unfortunate enough to suffer from it. It is caused by a tiny mutation, a single incorrect letter among some six billion total letters of one‚Äôs DNA
16. Kim‚Äôs Mysterious Recovery: Diagnosed with WHIM from birth. By age 58, she was symptom-free for over 20 years, without treatment. Her daughters still had the disease. Kim‚Äôs skin cells still had the mutation. Her blood cells did not, the mutated gene was missing. DNA from one of her chromosomes was heavily damaged and rearranged.
17. Chromothripsis: A rare event where a chromosome shatters and reassembles itself. Typically deadly or causes cancer, but in Kim‚Äôs case, it deleted the faulty gene. This happened in a stem cell (Hematopoietic stem cells has the power to give rise to all types of blood cells and repopulate the immune system) that regenerated her entire immune system. That one stem cell gave rise to all her healthy blood cells. Her body essentially cured itself by deleting the disease-causing gene. Other rare cases exist of people being spontaneously cured of genetic diseases like SCID (bubble boy disease) due to accidental genetic corrections
18. Inspired by nature, scientists began developing intentional gene-editing tools; Achieving this required knowing:: What the genome is; How it‚Äôs built; How it can be safely modified
19. Genome: A mix of gene + chromosome; It‚Äôs the full instruction manual of an organism; Tells cells how to grow, function, and pass traits on; Responsible for all traits: height, skin color, disease risk, etc
20. DNA is the basic material, a long string of genetic code. A gene is a specific section of DNA with instructions for making something (like a protein). A chromosome is a big package of DNA that contains many genes. The genome is the full collection of all your chromosomes, your entire genetic code.
21. DNA Structure Basics: DNA is made of four building blocks called nucleotides: A (Adenine), T (Thymine), G (Guanine), C (Cytosine)
Double Helix: DNA has two strands twisted into a spiral ladder (the double helix). The sides of the ladder are made of sugar-phosphate backbones.
    The rungs are base pairs:
       A always pairs with T
       G always pairs with C
22. Base Pairing = Genetic Stability
The above mentioned precise pairing allows DNA to copy itself accurately. Before a cell divides, enzymes unzip the DNA, and new strands are built using base-pair rules ‚Äî creating two identical copies.
23. DNA ‚Üí RNA ‚Üí Protein: DNA is copied into RNA (transcription). RNA is similar to DNA, but uses U (uracil) instead of T, and has a different sugar. RNA is used to build proteins (translation). Every 3 RNA letters = 1 amino acid, the building blocks of proteins.
24. A gene = a segment of DNA that makes a protein. A genome = all the DNA in an organism. Humans have ~3.2 billion DNA letters and ~21,000 protein-coding genes
25. Human genome = 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total; one set from each parent). Extra or missing chromosomes can cause diseases (e.g., Down syndrome = extra chromosome 21). Mitochondria also have their own DNA (inherited only from the mother)
26. Mutations
 a. Substitution (one letter swapped): Example: Sickle cell: A ‚Üí T in the HBB gene = malformed hemoglobin
 b. Insertion/Deletion: Example: Huntington‚Äôs = repeated DNA letters | Cystic fibrosis = 3-letter deletion
27. DNA sequencing = reading the genetic code letter by letter | DNA is double-stranded, but the two strands can be separated (unzipped) by heat or enzymes. This breaks the hydrogen bonds between base pairs (A‚ÄìT, G‚ÄìC), giving us single-stranded DNA. Reading just one strand is enough (Guess Why)
28. Early researchers realized that instead of correcting tiny mutations directly, they could insert healthy replacement genes into cells. Inspired by how viruses naturally inject their own DNA into host cells, scientists began using viruses as delivery tools, or ‚Äúvectors,‚Äù for therapeutic genes. In the 1960s, physician Stanfield Rogers tried this on two girls with a rare genetic disorder, using a rabbit virus he believed carried a helpful gene‚Äîbut the experiment failed. Still, his bold attempt sparked a breakthrough: viruses, despite early failures, became powerful tools in gene therapy.  In the 1970s‚Äì80s, scientists learned to engineer lab-made DNA and safely insert it into cells using viruses. Gene therapy advanced, but setbacks occurred‚Äîincluding patient death (1999) and leukemia cases due to accidental activation of cancer genes.
29. üß¨ Recessive Disease: Both gene copies (one from each parent) must be mutated for the disease to appear. If only one gene copy is mutated, the person is a carrier but usually healthy.
Example: Sickle cell disease ‚Äì You need two faulty HBB genes to have the disease.
üß¨ Dominant Disease: Only one gene copy needs to be mutated to cause the disease. The faulty gene overrides the normal one. Example: Huntington‚Äôs disease or WHIM syndrome ‚Äì Even one mutated gene causes symptoms.
30. Scientists realized they needed tools to fix faulty genes at the source, not just add copies. New Approaches Explored: Researchers began experimenting with editing RNA and DNA directly in cells and animal models, enabling precise genetic modifications
