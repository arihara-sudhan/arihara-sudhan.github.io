1. Zinc Finger Protein: Recognizer of DNA Bases: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine
2. Nuclease: Cutting Protein
3. ZFNs: Zinc Finger Protein + Nuclease: Kandupidi + Cut Pannu
4. If a sequence is common say, ACG, cutting them all will lead to Cell Death, Cancer
 - Zing Finger can bind only with a nucleotide of 3 bases
 - CRISPR turn offs Genes which let us know to what property that particular Gene Combination contribute to
 - We need to do Gene-Knockout using Technologies like CRISPR
5. If a sequence is uncommon  say, ACGTTGCAACTGGTCTA, cutting this unique sequence is precise
 - We target only the disease-causing gene
 - Leave the rest of the genome untouched
6. CRISPR: Pattern found in Bacterial DNA
  Pattern: REPEAT-UNIQUE-REPEAT-UNIQUE-REPEAT
  REPEAT: Short and Similar
  UNIQUE: Comes from Viral Attack to Bacteria
7. Bacteria recorded memories of past viral infections in its DNA using CRISPR. Like a ‚Äúwanted‚Äù list for viruses
8. Cas Protein: Cas proteins can cut DNA at very specific spots
Cas9	Cuts double-stranded DNA: Gene editing (most common)
Cas12	Also cuts DNA, but can do more types of cuts: Advanced editing
Cas13	Cuts RNA instead of DNA	RNA editing and diagnostics
9. PAM: PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) is a short DNA sequence that is essential for CRISPR-Cas9 to recognize and cut a specific target in the genome. Cas9 doesn't search directly for the target sequence; instead, it scans the DNA for the PAM sequence (commonly "NGG"), and only when it finds PAM does it check the 20 bases just before it to see if they match the guide RNA. Without PAM, Cas9 won‚Äôt even stop to check the DNA ‚Äî meaning no recognition, no binding, and no cutting. So, PAM acts like a ‚Äúlicense‚Äù or ‚Äútrigger‚Äù that tells Cas9 where it's allowed to cut.
10. Double-Stranded Break: When Cas9 cuts the DNA, it breaks both strands of the DNA double helix at the target spot
11. Cut will be HEALED: REPAIRED AUTOMATICALLY
	NHEJ (Non-Homologous End Joining) is the cell‚Äôs quick and easy way of fixing broken DNA. When CRISPR cuts the DNA, the cell rushes to glue the ends back together. This method is fast and happens in most cells, but it‚Äôs not very careful ‚Äî it often makes small mistakes by adding or removing a few letters (called insertions or deletions). These little errors can break the gene so it no longer works. That‚Äôs why NHEJ is useful when we want to turn off or knock out a gene.
	HDR (Homology Directed Repair) is a slower but smarter way the cell can fix DNA. Instead of just gluing the ends, it uses a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù ‚Äî like a copy or instruction manual ‚Äî to fix or replace the damaged part. This method is very accurate and allows scientists to correct gene mutations or even insert new genes. However, HDR only works well under certain conditions, usually when the cell is dividing. Because of this, HDR is harder to use, but it‚Äôs great for precise gene editing.
12. The gRNA (guide RNA) acts like a GPS, directing the Cas9 protein to the specific DNA sequence that needs to be cut. However, Cas9 can‚Äôt cut just anywhere‚Äîit needs to see a small tag next to the target site called the PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif). PAM isn‚Äôt part of the guidance system but acts like a "cut here" signal or a permission slip; without it, Cas9 won‚Äôt make the cut, even if the gRNA is correct. So, the gRNA shows where to go, and the PAM confirms whether it‚Äôs allowed to cut there.
13. Vectors: To get Cas9 and gRNA into the cell, we need a carrier (like a box) to deliver them. These carriers are called vectors
14. OFFTARGETS: Off-targets are accidental edits in the wrong place

15. WHIM Syndrome: Affecting just a few dozen people worldwide, WHIM is a painful, potentially deadly immunodeficiency disease that makes life difficult for those unfortunate enough to suffer from it. It is caused by a tiny mutation, a single incorrect letter among some six billion total letters of one‚Äôs DNA
16. Kim‚Äôs Mysterious Recovery: Diagnosed with WHIM from birth. By age 58, she was symptom-free for over 20 years, without treatment. Her daughters still had the disease. Kim‚Äôs skin cells still had the mutation. Her blood cells did not, the mutated gene was missing. DNA from one of her chromosomes was heavily damaged and rearranged.
17. Chromothripsis: A rare event where a chromosome shatters and reassembles itself. Typically deadly or causes cancer, but in Kim‚Äôs case, it deleted the faulty gene. This happened in a stem cell (Hematopoietic stem cells has the power to give rise to all types of blood cells and repopulate the immune system) that regenerated her entire immune system. That one stem cell gave rise to all her healthy blood cells. Her body essentially cured itself by deleting the disease-causing gene. Other rare cases exist of people being spontaneously cured of genetic diseases like SCID (bubble boy disease) due to accidental genetic corrections
18. Inspired by nature, scientists began developing intentional gene-editing tools; Achieving this required knowing:: What the genome is; How it‚Äôs built; How it can be safely modified
19. Genome: A mix of gene + chromosome; It‚Äôs the full instruction manual of an organism; Tells cells how to grow, function, and pass traits on; Responsible for all traits: height, skin color, disease risk, etc
20. DNA is the basic material, a long string of genetic code. A gene is a specific section of DNA with instructions for making something (like a protein). A chromosome is a big package of DNA that contains many genes. The genome is the full collection of all your chromosomes, your entire genetic code.
21. DNA Structure Basics: DNA is made of four building blocks called nucleotides: A (Adenine), T (Thymine), G (Guanine), C (Cytosine)
Double Helix: DNA has two strands twisted into a spiral ladder (the double helix). The sides of the ladder are made of sugar-phosphate backbones.
    The rungs are base pairs:
       A always pairs with T
       G always pairs with C
22. Base Pairing = Genetic Stability
The above mentioned precise pairing allows DNA to copy itself accurately. Before a cell divides, enzymes unzip the DNA, and new strands are built using base-pair rules ‚Äî creating two identical copies.

23. DNA ‚Üí RNA ‚Üí Protein: DNA is copied into RNA (transcription). RNA is similar to DNA, but uses U (uracil) instead of T, and has a different sugar. RNA is used to build proteins (translation). Every 3 RNA letters = 1 amino acid, the building blocks of proteins.
24. A gene = a segment of DNA that makes a protein. A genome = all the DNA in an organism. Humans have ~3.2 billion DNA letters and ~21,000 protein-coding genes
25. Human genome = 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total; one set from each parent). Extra or missing chromosomes can cause diseases (e.g., Down syndrome = extra chromosome 21). Mitochondria also have their own DNA (inherited only from the mother)
26. Mutations
 a. Substitution (one letter swapped): Example: Sickle cell: A ‚Üí T in the HBB gene = malformed hemoglobin
 b. Insertion/Deletion: Example: Huntington‚Äôs = repeated DNA letters | Cystic fibrosis = 3-letter deletion
27. DNA sequencing = reading the genetic code letter by letter | DNA is double-stranded, but the two strands can be separated (unzipped) by heat or enzymes. This breaks the hydrogen bonds between base pairs (A‚ÄìT, G‚ÄìC), giving us single-stranded DNA. Reading just one strand is enough (Guess Why)

28. Early researchers realized that instead of correcting tiny mutations directly, they could insert healthy replacement genes into cells. Inspired by how viruses naturally inject their own DNA into host cells, scientists began using viruses as delivery tools, or ‚Äúvectors,‚Äù for therapeutic genes. In the 1960s, physician Stanfield Rogers tried this on two girls with a rare genetic disorder, using a rabbit virus he believed carried a helpful gene‚Äîbut the experiment failed. Still, his bold attempt sparked a breakthrough: viruses, despite early failures, became powerful tools in gene therapy.  In the 1970s‚Äì80s, scientists learned to engineer lab-made DNA and safely insert it into cells using viruses. Gene therapy advanced, but setbacks occurred‚Äîincluding patient death (1999) and leukemia cases due to accidental activation of cancer genes.
29. üß¨ Recessive Disease: Both gene copies (one from each parent) must be mutated for the disease to appear. If only one gene copy is mutated, the person is a carrier but usually healthy.
Example: Sickle cell disease ‚Äì You need two faulty HBB genes to have the disease.
üß¨ Dominant Disease: Only one gene copy needs to be mutated to cause the disease. The faulty gene overrides the normal one. Example: Huntington‚Äôs disease or WHIM syndrome ‚Äì Even one mutated gene causes symptoms.
30. Scientists realized they needed tools to fix faulty genes at the source, not just add copies. New Approaches Explored: Researchers began experimenting with editing RNA and DNA directly in cells and animal models, enabling precise genetic modifications

31. Sickle cell is a recessive genetic disease: One must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to be affected. If someone only inherits one copy, he/she is a carrier; he/she usually doesn‚Äôt get sick, but he/she can pass it to his/her kids
32. In sickle cell disease: A single letter in the gene is changed: an ‚ÄúA‚Äù is swapped for a ‚ÄúT‚Äù at position 17. This changes one amino acid in the hemoglobin protein: glutamate ‚Üí valine. Even though it‚Äôs just 10 atoms out of 8000+, this causes: Hemoglobin proteins to stick together. Red blood cells to change shape (become sickle-shaped)
Health problems: anemia, pain, stroke risk, infections
33. Chromosomes and DNA in Humans: Humans normally have 46 chromosomes in almost every cell: 23 from the mother and 23 from the father. These chromosomes carry DNA, which is the instruction manual for how your body works. A few exceptions exist, for example, people with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21 (so 47 total).
Not All DNA Is in the Nucleus: Most DNA is in the nucleus (the cell‚Äôs control center). But there‚Äôs also a small amount of DNA inside mitochondria, the energy factories of the cell. This mitochondrial DNA has only about 16,000 letters (tiny compared to nuclear DNA) and is inherited only from mother. A mutation is a change in the DNA code. Even a single-letter change (called a substitution) can disrupt a gene and cause a disease.
34. Rogers' Hypothesis: Dr. Stanfield Rogers believed the Shope virus could deliver a gene that increases arginase production. He imagined using modified viruses to deliver useful genes to treat genetic diseases. Two girls in Germany had a rare genetic disease (hyperargininemia) caused by lack of arginase. Rogers injected the Shope virus into the girls, hoping it would fix their condition. The virus didn‚Äôt work. It did not contain the arginase gene. The therapy had no effect on the girls. Rogers was criticized for performing an unsafe and premature human experiment
35. Why Viruses Work So Well: They naturally evolved to: Infiltrate cells of all types, Inject their own DNA efficiently, Bypass cell defenses like expert hackers, Viral vectors can deliver genes with almost 100% success rate, Scientists use viruses to sneak therapeutic genes into cells like Trojan horses carrying a hidden cure
36. Viruses Don't Just Enter Cells, They Stay: Viruses can insert their DNA into the host cell‚Äôs genome ‚Äî making the change permanent. In the 1920s‚Äì30s, scientists were puzzled by viruses reactivating in bacteria long after infection. These viruses hide their DNA inside bacterial chromosomes and reactivate later when conditions favor infection. Retroviruses (like HIV) splice their DNA into human genomes, making infections hard to cure. Around 8% of human DNA (250 million letters) comes from ancient retroviral infections of our ancestors
37. Recombinant DNA Revolution (1970s‚Äì1980s): Scientists learned to cut, paste, and edit DNA in the lab. They began modifying viruses to carry therapeutic genes without harming cells. Viruses as Gene Delivery Tools Dangerous parts of viruses were removed. Viruses became safe ‚Äúmissiles‚Äù that could deliver helpful genes into cells.
Success in Mice ‚Üí Human Trials Begin: By the late 1980s, lab-made retroviruses successfully delivered genes in mice. Human trials began, starting with ADA-SCID, a rare immune disease. Used a virus carrying the healthy ADA gene to help two patients. Results Were Unclear Patients showed some immune improvement... But it might‚Äôve been due to other treatments, not the gene therapy. Only a few cells actually received the gene, meaning the virus delivery wasn‚Äôt very efficient
38. Gene therapy has come a long way since its early trials, with better viral tools now used to treat many genetic diseases like SCID, cystic fibrosis, and some cancers. However, it hasn‚Äôt been a perfect solution. In some cases, it caused serious side effects like immune reactions or even cancer due to the way viral DNA was inserted into the body. Also, gene therapy doesn‚Äôt work well for certain conditions like Huntington‚Äôs disease, where the faulty gene overpowers the healthy one. For these tough cases, scientists realized they needed a better method‚Äînot just adding new genes, but fixing the broken ones directly
39. Virus-free methods: Lab-made DNA
Scientists tried simple methods to get lab-made DNA into cells (no viruses). They injected DNA into fertilized mouse eggs. The mice grew up with the new gene and passed it to their babies. This helped scientists test how genes work by watching what changed in the animals. It was the early foundation for future gene editing tools like CRISPR

40. Capecchi saw that lab DNA was not random, it clustered together in cells. This was due to homologous recombination, a natural DNA swap mechanism. It allows similar DNA sequences to match up and combine accurately. This process is used during reproduction to mix parental genes. Biologists had already been using this process in bacteria and yeast. This discovery helped scientists understand how to precisely target genes ‚Äî a big step toward gene editing! The cell‚Äôs machinery had recognized the foreign DNA because it looked similar to its own sequence. It aligned the sequences and integrated the foreign DNA at the matching site.
41. Oliver Smithies ‚Äì Key Discovery
Goal: Test if lab-made DNA can replace a specific gene in human cells (not just insert randomly).
Used human bladder tumor cells containing the beta-globin gene. Designed a modified (recombinant) version of the same gene in the lab. Mixed the recombinant DNA with calcium phosphate. Added it directly to cells (no viruses, no special delivery tools). Some cells recognized the similarity between the artificial and native gene. Used homologous recombination to replace their own beta-globin gene with the lab-made one. Cells can swap native DNA with foreign DNA at an exact location ‚Äî as long as the sequences match closely. Proved that precise gene editing is possible in human cells using natural repair mechanisms. Introduced the concept of gene targeting, which is the foundation of modern genome editing
42. Martin Evans‚Äôs lab showed it was possible to: Modify mouse embryonic stem cells via gene targeting. Inject them into embryos to produce genetically altered mice
43. In therapeutic applications, homologous recombination was rare. Instead, cells often used nonhomologous (random) recombination, inserting new DNA incorrectly. This happened ~100x more frequently than the desired, precise repair.
üß™ Result: Only ~1% of edited cells got the gene at the correct spot, too low for medical use
44. Jack Szostak‚Äôs model (1983) showed that if there's a double-strand break (DSB) in DNA: The cell activates its repair system. It then looks for a similar sequence (homologous DNA) to fix the break. If you give the cell lab-made DNA with matching sequences, it can use that as a repair template ‚Üí leading to accurate gene editing
45. Tools like CRISPR-Cas9 create a deliberate break in DNA at a specific spot. Then, scientists provide a repair template (the lab-made DNA).
The cell says: ‚ÄúUh-oh! DNA broken! Let me fix it using this similar DNA nearby‚Ä¶‚Äù And it performs precise repair (homologous recombination)
46. Creating a targeted DNA break + giving a repair template = Efficient gene editing
47. In 1994, Maria Jasin did an experiment: She used an enzyme (called I-SceI) that can cut DNA. But this enzyme only cuts when it sees a very specific 18-letter DNA code. Mouse DNA didn‚Äôt have this exact code, so she added it. Then she gave the cell a correct gene copy and cut the DNA at that new spot.
What happened? üëâ The cell repaired the broken gene using the new copy she gave it
48. Scientists said: ‚ÄúWe need programmable scissors that can cut wherever we want, not just where I-SceI can cut.‚Äù
49. In the 1990s, scientists realized that existing nucleases were too imprecise for gene editing because they recognized very short DNA sequences that appeared too frequently in the genome, leading to random and harmful cuts. To solve this, in 1996, Srinivasan Chandrasegaran created a hybrid enzyme by combining two natural components: the FokI nuclease, which could cut DNA but lacked specificity, and zinc finger proteins, which could recognize specific DNA sequences through finger-like domains, each binding to a 3-letter DNA segment. By assembling these zinc fingers in different combinations, scientists could target longer, unique DNA sequences, making it possible to cut DNA precisely where needed. This engineered tool, called a Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN), marked a major breakthrough in enabling programmable and accurate gene editing
50. Each zinc finger typically binds to a 3-letter DNA sequence. So, if one zinc finger binds to "GAA", another to "TGC", and another to "CCT", you can link them together to form a zinc finger array that recognizes the 9-letter sequence: "GAATGCCCT".
So:
    Zinc Finger 1 ‚Üí "GAA"
    Zinc Finger 2 ‚Üí "TGC"
    Zinc Finger 3 ‚Üí "CCT"
    Together ‚Üí targets "GAATGCCCT"
51. Limitations of ZFNs: Difficult to design and expensive: Required expertise in protein engineering | Unpredictable performance: some ZFNs failed to cut or were too random. Because of these issues, ZFNs were not widely adopted despite their promise
52. Next: TALENs (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) | TALENs came from plant pathogens (Xanthomonas). Like ZFNs, they had repeatable parts that could be customized. Key advantage: Each TALE segment recognized 1 letter of DNA, making them easier to design. Scientists could easily assemble custom DNA-binding proteins. TALENs were better than ZFNs: easier to design and build. Worked well in gene editing applications

53. Chromatin: Package in which the DNA is stored inside a cell nucleus; Packed
54. Types of Chromatin: 
	Euchromatin	-> Loosely packed: Genes are active, easy to access
	Heterochromatin	-> Tightly packed: Genes are inactive, hard to access
If a gene or region is tightly wrapped in chromatin, the CRISPR machinery (Cas9 + gRNA) can‚Äôt easily reach it. This is why the same gRNA might work in vitro (where DNA is open) but fail in vivo, where chromatin blocks it
55. CRISPR Discovery Context: Discovered as a DNA region in bacteria; acronym stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.
IMG_URL crispr.png
56. CRISPR Structure: 
Repeats: Identical ~30-base sequences (palindromes).
Spacers: Unique sequences in between each repeat.
Clustered: These repeat-spacer arrays are found in one region, not scattered across the genome
57. Function of Spacers: Spacers are derived from viral DNA‚Äîfunction as a ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of past infections in bacteria
58. CRISPR System Role: A bacterial immune system that defends against viruses by storing viral DNA snippets as spacers
59. Jill Banfield's Role: Geomicrobiologist who first approached Jennifer Doudna about CRISPR after detecting it in microbial data
60. Early Scientific Context: At the time (2006), CRISPR was obscure‚Äîfew papers existed compared to RNA interference, which was already well-studied
61. Doudna‚Äôs Initial Impression: Intrigued by the precision and uniformity of CRISPR repeats; palindromic nature stood out
62. Comparison with Other Repeats: Other bacterial DNA repeats (like REP and BIME) exist but lacked CRISPR‚Äôs regularity and defined structure.
63. Significance of Repeats: CRISPR repeats are palindromic, i.e., they read nearly the same forwards and backwards, which aids in forming secondary structures in RNA.
64. Why It Mattered: This structured and uniform DNA region hinted at a functional role, not just junk DNA prompting further research
