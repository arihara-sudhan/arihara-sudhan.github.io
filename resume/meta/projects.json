    "description": "The goal of this research was to develop a method for few-shot classification of documents with high intra-class variance. Initially, Triplet Loss was used for few-shot training, and experiments began with ResNet-50, whose convolution-based embeddings captured simple patterns, achieving 74% similarity search accuracy using FAISS. To enhance performance, I explored Google ViT's last hidden state for embeddings, but it performed poorly. Transitioning to DiT (Document Image Transformer), pretrained on the RVL-CDIP dataset with masking as the pretext task, yielded 96% accuracy. Interestingly, I observed classification models exhibiting few-shot behavior and vice versa. Hierarchical classification was introduced, where a superclass like 'Advertisement' included subclasses such as 'Toothpaste Advertisement' and 'Mobile Advertisement'. Through careful dataset annotation, we achieved 100% accuracy, though generalization remained limited. To address this, I extracted textual features via OCR using Tesseract and BERT, combined them with visual features from DiT, and performed multimodal training, significantly improving generalization capabilities.",

    "description": "As part of the Speech Profiling team, I was tasked with handling varying sampling rates. Using the librosa package, I resampled input audio to a standard frequency, accommodating various input formats such as audio files or raw samples. Additionally, I classified audio using a CNN, converting audio files into Mel Spectrograms and employing a ResNet architecture for classification, achieving an accuracy of 95.2%. Beyond this, I gained deeper insights into the underlying processes, learning tools like Poetry and Docker. I also experimented with Fourier Transformations to decompose audio into frequency components and explored audio data across different sampling rates.",

    "description": "Using LangChain, I have developed a conversational AI bot that answers queries based on *Thirukkural*, the timeless Tamil literary masterpiece. To enable efficient retrieval, I employed FAISS for vector embeddings and similarity search. The system is further enhanced using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Falcon LLM, ensuring insightful responses rooted in *Thirukkural's* wisdom. Since *Thirukkural* offers profound solutions to life's challenges, this system transforms its curative literary essence into a RAG-powered knowledge frameworkâ€”one that not only informs but also heals.",
