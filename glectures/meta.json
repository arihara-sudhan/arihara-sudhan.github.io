        "about": "I had the pleasure of visiting Kamaraj College of Engineering Virudhunagar where I conducted a guest lecture as part of the event titled MEET AI. I was greeted with a warm and poetic welcome that set a beautiful tone for the day. The students had the opportunity to meet ARI and I guided them through the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence starting from the theory of biological neurons activation functions perceptrons and artificial neurons to exploring concepts like linearly separable and non-separable problems the XOR and OR problems convolutional neural networks backpropagation and weight updation. The session received wonderful feedback from the students and I genuinely enjoyed every moment of the experience. A heartfelt thank you to Raj Sir the HoD ma'am and all the faculty members who supported and made this session truly memorable.",

        "about": "I had a wonderful experience visiting Sri Sairam Engineering College, Chennai, where I conducted a session titled Deep Learning with TensorFlow: From Tensors to Neural Network Training. We explored core concepts such as tensors, PyTorch basics, biological neurons, activation functions, perceptrons, artificial neurons, linearly separable and non-separable problems, the XOR and OR problems, convolutional neural networks, backpropagation, and weight updation. The session was well-received, and I truly appreciated the enthusiastic participation and positive feedback from the students. I also had the opportunity to visit the Startup Incubation Centre at Sri Sairam and explore exciting AR and VR technologies, which was an inspiring experience. One of the highlights was seeing the beautiful Caduceus statue in front of the Siddha College, a symbol that truly stood out. A heartfelt thank you to Ulaganathan Sir, HoD Ma'am, and all the staff members who supported and made this enriching day possible.",
